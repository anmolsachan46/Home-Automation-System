# Home-Automation-System
This was my college project which I was working on as a hobby and ended up submitting for my semester.  Nothing fancy here just an Arduino board, Bluetooth and android smartphone. Viola! Your home automation is good to go.

Use the customizable codes given accroding to your requirement. I have placed an android app as well in the repo but you can always build your own app or use some other app that works on bluetooth and sends a signal.

just know what the signal is and then make changes in the code and burn it to the board.
